This guide assumes you're using Visual Studio Code

Step 1: Create a Github repository
  - Don't forget to add a .gitignore file! There's a Unity template in this repository or
    readily online

Step 2: Create a Unity project

Step 3: Clone the repository into the Unity Project directory
- Open Visual Studio Code or a command terminal of your choice
- enter the command: cd "Path/To/Project"
- Enter command: git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git
- You should now have a directory within your Unity project with the same name as your Github Repository
  - Simply move the contents of this directory into the main project directory

Step 4: Verify the Connection
- In Visual Studio Code check the Source Control tab. It should read the Git repository
- You should now be able to use Git with Unity!
